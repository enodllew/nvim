# My neovim config

This config inspired by and partially based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

This repository is updated from time to time..

## How to install
* `git clone https://github.com/enodllew/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`
* Just run `nvim`

[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is used as a dependency manager.

## Requirements
* `npm`
* `fd`
* `fzf`
* `ripgrep`

I think that's all.
